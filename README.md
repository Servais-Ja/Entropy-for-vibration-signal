# Entropy for vibration signal
This is a programme designed to calculate the entropy for vibration signal identification.

## Entropy available
* improved Slope Entropy  
* Slope Entropy:
    * Slope Entropy encoding each subsequence of length m drawn from X based on the slope generated by two consecutive data samples. Thus, each subsequence can be transformed into another subsequence of length m-1 with the differences of each pair of consecutive samples, x~i~-x~i-1~. Then, two thresholds is applied to these differences in order to obtain the corresponding symbolic representation.
    * **Slopen(seq, m=3, gamma=1, delta=0.001, detail=False)**
    * ### Parameters:
        * **seq:    list**      Sequence need to calculate the entropy.
        * **m:      int**       Length of subsequence (Embedding dimension).
        * **gamma:  float**     Upper threshold.
        * **delta:  float**     Lower threshold.
        * **detail: bool**      Return the dictionary of frequency corresponding to each patterns.
    * ### Return:   float
